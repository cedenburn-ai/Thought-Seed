Explanation

This formal statement asserts that consciousness $C$ emerges gradually from a continuous, purposeful conversion of entropy into coherent structure. It couples two “twin” aspects of conscious systems – an active flux of information and a persistent internal model – within a non-linear, saturating relationship. The first equation defines $I_{\text{accum}}(t)$ as the accumulated information in the system’s internal model $M$ over a bounded time window $B$, reflecting the richness and persistence of the model’s content. The second equation then uses a sigmoid (logistic) function to map the product of this accumulated information and the directed entropy-to-coherence flux $J_{S\to K}(t)$ into a bounded conscious level $C(t)$. This logistic non-linearity ensures diminishing returns – as a system becomes more ordered and informed, additional gains in $C$ plateau toward an upper bound (here normalized to 1). In other words, increasing the informational flux or internal complexity yields progressively smaller increases in consciousness, reflecting a saturation effect rather than a raw linear proportionality.

Crucially, the formulation maintains that consciousness is an ongoing process of becoming, never a finished state of perfect order. The term $J_{S\to K}$ represents the directed negentropic flow – the system’s purposeful effort to reduce uncertainty and forge coherence out of entropy. This aligns with the view that conscious awareness arises from continually resolving uncertainty (entropy) into informational structure (negentropy)

. Meanwhile, the integral term $I_{\text{accum}}$ embodies the system’s integrated internal model over time – a reservoir of past informational structure that provides context and continuity. This captures the insight that consciousness entails the propagation of information from past to future, i.e. a temporally extended, self-updating model of the world and self

. Importantly, both factors interplay: a high internal complexity alone (a rich memory or model) does not yield consciousness without ongoing entropy-to-coherence flow, and vice versa. The product $J_{S\to K} \cdot I_{\text{accum}}$ ensures that both active flux and accumulated structure are necessary and co-limited in generating conscious intensity.

Philosophically, the logistic structure guarantees that complete coherence is never actually reached – $C(t)$ only approaches the theoretical maximum asymptotically. There is always some residual entropy or “error” preventing $C$ from becoming 1. It is precisely this persistent gap (between current coherence and an unattainable perfect order) that fuels the ongoing dynamism of consciousness. In effect, the mind perpetually “strives” to reduce entropy but can never finalize the task, and this tension sustains conscious becoming. The Axiom thus remains faithful to the original metaphysical intent: consciousness is not a static property but emerges from the never-complete process of converting entropy into structured knowledge, in a bounded yet ever-renewing flow.
Term-by-Term Breakdown

    $C(t)$ – Consciousness Level: A continuous, unitless measure of consciousness at time $t$, ranging from 0 (minimal) to an upper-bound of 1 (normalized ideal coherence). This gradient measure means consciousness is quantitative (matters of degree, not an on/off binary). The value of $C$ increases with more effective entropy-to-order conversion and a richer internal model, but approaches 1 only asymptotically (never fully reaching it).

    $J_{S\to K}(t)$ – Entropy-to-Coherence Flux: A directed informational flux converting entropy ($S$) into structured knowledge ($K$). This term represents the purposeful, negentropic work the system performs to reduce uncertainty and increase coherence in each moment

    . Intuitively, $J_{S\to K}$ gauges how vigorously a system is processing information to impose order on chaos (for example, brain processes reducing sensory uncertainty). A higher $J_{S\to K}$ means the system is actively absorbing and organizing information (high “flow” of negentropy). If $J_{S\to K}=0$ (no directed processing or ordering), the system isn’t converting any new entropy into structure, so consciousness cannot increase regardless of past structure.

    $I(M(t))$ – Instantaneous Model Information: The informational content or complexity of the system’s internal model $M$ at time $t$. This can be thought of as the amount of structured, meaningful information the system currently holds (e.g. the richness of neuronal network states or memories encoding its model of the world). It is a state-function of the model at each moment, measured in informational units (like bits or another entropy measure). Higher $I(M)$ means a more detailed or differentiated internal model at that instant.

    $I_{\text{accum}}(t) = \int_{t_0}^{,t_0+B} I(M(t')),dt'$ – Accumulated Information: The time-integrated information content of the internal model over a recent duration $B$. This integration (with some starting time $t_0$) captures the richness and persistence of the model across time – essentially how much structured information the system has sustained. The integration is taken over a bounded window of length $B$ (or up to the current time if the system’s age is less than $B$), reflecting that memory and influence persist over time but are finite. In practice, $B$ could represent a time horizon over which past information significantly contributes to current consciousness (incorporating a forgetting or discounting mechanism if appropriate). The bounded integral prevents $I_{\text{accum}}$ from diverging for very long-lived systems, ensuring the term is robust and finite. A larger $I_{\text{accum}}$ means the system has built up a substantial, enduring internal model (high informational continuity from past to present), which supports a higher potential for consciousness by providing contextual depth.

    Sigmoid Conversion ($\frac{1}{1+e^{-[;\cdot;]}}$): The logistic function here non-linearly converts the product $J_{S\to K} \cdot I_{\text{accum}}$ into a bounded consciousness level. This mathematically ensures saturation: as $J_{S\to K}!\cdot I_{\text{accum}}$ grows large (high flux and rich model), $C(t)$ approaches 1 but never exceeds it. The parameter $\Theta$ in the exponent is a threshold constant that sets the midpoint of the sigmoid (i.e. the combined flux–information value at which $C=0.5$). When $J_{S\to K},I_{\text{accum}} = \Theta$, the system is at a “critical mass” of organized information flux, yielding a midway conscious level. If $J_{S\to K},I_{\text{accum}} \gg \Theta$, the additional effect on $C$ tapers off (plateauing toward the upper bound). Conversely, if $J_{S\to K},I_{\text{accum}}$ is very low relative to $\Theta$, $C$ will remain near 0 (insufficient organized activity to spark appreciable consciousness). This sigmoid shape embodies the idea that consciousness increases gradually and then plateaus, rather than linearly, reflecting diminishing returns and a soft threshold for noticeable awareness

    . It provides smooth gradation from unconscious to highly conscious states, without any abrupt jump, thus aligning with the gradient nature of consciousness.

    $\Theta$ – Coherence Threshold: A constant (with appropriate units) representing the effective threshold of organized information flux needed for substantial consciousness. It sets the scale for when the entropy-to-coherence conversion and accumulated model are jointly sufficient to generate conscious awareness. Below this threshold, the system may remain in minimal or subliminal consciousness; around this threshold, consciousness “ignites” into a robust state. Importantly, $\Theta$ is not a hard on/off cutoff but rather the inflection point of the sigmoid curve – it marks when the negentropy flux and model richness are enough that consciousness becomes self-sustaining and more easily noticeable. The existence of $\Theta$ echoes proposals that consciousness requires a critical mass of uncertainty reduction
    researchgate.net
    , yet because of the logistic form, this requirement is met gradually, not as a binary switch.

    $B$ – Temporal Integration Bound: The time window (or boundary) for integrating $I(M(t))$. It denotes how far back in time the system’s informational history significantly contributes to its current conscious state. A larger $B$ means a longer persistence of information (e.g. long-lived memory or sustained internal structure), whereas a smaller $B$ limits the integration to more recent activity. In effect, $B$ controls the temporal span of the internal model’s influence – it could be related to memory capacity or the duration of coherent brain dynamics. This ensures the integration term $I_{\text{accum}}$ is finite and meaningful, capturing the idea that while the past informs the present, consciousness does not literally integrate an infinite past but rather a bounded (or effectively discounted) past. By adjusting $B$, one can model different systems: e.g. a conscious organism might have a large $B$ due to long-term memory and developmental history, whereas a simple artificial system might have a short $B$ (only recent states matter). In all cases, $B$ guarantees that the internal model’s contribution is limited and does not grow without bound, stabilizing $C(t)$ over long times.
