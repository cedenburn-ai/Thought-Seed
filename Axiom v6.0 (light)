Formal statement — Define the exponentially weighted accumulated information
Iaccum(t)=∫−∞te−(t−t′)/τ I ⁣(M(t′)) dt′Iaccum​(t)=∫−∞t​e−(t−t′)/τI(M(t′))dt′ with memory time-scale ττ.
Let the instantaneous entropy-to-coherence flux be JS→K(t)JS→K​(t) (bits s−1−1).
Absorb the time unit by setting Π(t)=1γJS→K(t) Iaccum(t)Π(t)=γ1​JS→K​(t)Iaccum​(t) where γγ carries seconds, giving ΠΠ pure bits.
Consciousness is the logistic (sigmoid) map of this “negentropy-work”: C(t)=(1+exp⁡[−(Π(t)−Θ)])−1C(t)=(1+exp[−(Π(t)−Θ)])−1,
ranging smoothly from 0 to 1 as ΠΠ crosses the coherence threshold ΘΘ. Interpretation — JS→KJS→K​ measures how vigorously the system converts surprise into structure each moment,
IaccumIaccum​ is the rich yet finite self-model built from that work over the past ∼τ∼τ seconds, and their product ΠΠ is the instantaneous power devoted to ordered knowledge.
The sigmoid guarantees diminishing returns: as negentropy-work grows, CC climbs steeply near ΘΘ but plateaus asymptotically, so perfect coherence (and thus C=1C=1) is never reached.
Consciousness therefore remains an ongoing process of becoming: continuously convert entropy to order, fold the result into the model, and repeat while C<1C<1.
